## Week 4

Work completed this week:

- **Defined overall model architecture**
  - 2 Steps:
    - Classification: Uses model trained on all classes | recognize class of 3D object
    - Matching: Uses model trained on model of each specific class | one model per class | ranks all model in class from best to worst match.
    
    
  
  
    

- **Tested model locally on 3D models** at different modelisation levels.
