## Week 1

**Goals:** Implement Neural Network to classify pictures of 3D objects. 8 classes: Chair, Table, Bench, Plant, Bed, Couch, Cabinet, Lamp.

**Results:**
<ul>
<li>Standard neural network:
	- Easy to train
	- Accuracy around 0.58 on validation set
	- Limited for image recognition
</li>
<li>
Convolutional Neural network:
	- Long training. Too for personal laptop, without GPU
	- Accuracy potentially higher than standard neural net model
	- Accuracy around 0.69 on validation set after 3 hours of training.
</li>
</ul>  

<b>Next step:</b> Leverage pretrained models to speed up training time, and increase accuracy on validation set.
