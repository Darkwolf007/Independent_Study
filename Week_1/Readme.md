## Week 1

**Goals:** Implement Neural Network to classify pictures of 3D objects. 8 classes: Chair, Table, Bench, Plant, Bed, Couch, Cabinet, Lamp.

**Results:**
<ul>
<li>Standard neural network:
		<ul>
		<li>Easy to train</li>
		<li>Accuracy around 0.58 on validation set</li>
		<li>Limited for image recognition</li>
		<ul/>
	</li>
Convolutional Neural network:
		<ul>
		<li>Long training. Too for personal laptop, without GPU</li>
		<li>Accuracy potentially higher than standard neural net model</li>
		<li>Accuracy around 0.69 on validation set after 3 hours of training.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>  

<b>Next step:</b> Leverage pretrained models to speed up training time, and increase accuracy on validation set.
