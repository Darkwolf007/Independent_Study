## Week 2

**Goals:** Implement Convolutional Neural network to classify pictures of 3D objects, based on pretrained models.

**Results:**
- VGG model:
	- Short training time
	- Accuracy around 0.8 on validation set
	- Strong overfitting after 20 epochs

- Convolutional Neural network:
	- Long training time
	- Accuracy around 0.65 on validaiton set. Noisy Accuracy.
	- Very Strong Overfitting after 60 epochs. 

**Next step:** Add hidden layers (maxPooling and DropOut) to counter overfitting. Try other pretrained model and compare performance.
