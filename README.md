Independent Study @ Harvard GSD

<b><h2>Suggestive CAD</h2></b>

<i>Independent Study Proposal | Spring 2018 | Stanislas Chaillou | Advisor : Prof. Andrew Witt | Collaboration : Thomas Trinelle </i>

<p align="justify">The utilization of machine intuition has been leveraged in countless industries, from voice recognition, to suggestive search on the web, down to CCTV image processing. As the design process in architecture happens mostly through the medium of 3D software (Rhinoceros 3D, Maya, 3DSmax), our discipline could also benefit from the help of machine-generated suggestions. This is the goal of this independent study: study and propose a way to assist the designer, through suggestive modeling. As designers draw in the 3D space, a machine-learning-based algorithm would be able to assist the designer by proposing alternative, similar or complementary options to them. 
In a nutshell, we would look into precedent works in the field of suggestive modeling, to finally come up with a methodology and a tool that would be able to suggest models to designers as they draw. 
Problematic
Can machine learning enhance simple CAD tasks, and even assist the designer in the design process, by suggesting potential design options?</p>

<b>Description</b>

<p align="justify">This project can be broken down in 2 parts: understanding what we want the tool to be able to recognize (commonly called the testing set), and what we want the tool to be trained on (the training set). 
In our case simplifying the challenge to simple objects will insure the feasibility of this independent study. Therefore, we will train the algorithm to be able to recognize chairs, tables, doors and windows. Consequently, our training set will be a serie of 3d objects of these category, found in the ShapeNet  Library. This database offers pre-labeled objects and 360-degree views of them. The size of the training set and the training methodology will be determined in the first weeks of the independent study.
Ideally, using Keras, a machine learning package for Python, we will be able to create a convolutional neural network model, that will be able to learn from our objectsâ€™ images.
Using this technic, our goal ultimately is to be able to give a label to an object being modeled by the user, search in an extensive database of models according to the found label, and finally serve the matches we find to the user, through a simple interface. For the sake of this independent study, it might be more realistic to simply create a web-app that will be able to perform this task, and reserve for later the integration of this tool as a plugin in traditional modeling software.
Overall, our tool would comply with the following scheme:</p>
